# 100 Python Projects in 100 Days

Welcome to my repository where I am challenging myself to create 100 different Python projects in 100 days! The goal of this project is to gradually increase the complexity of the projects from simple beginner-level programs to more advanced applications.

## About

This repository is a collection of 100 Python projects I am building over 100 days. Each project is designed to help me improve my Python skills and explore different libraries and concepts. The projects will start off simple and grow in complexity as I progress, allowing me to learn new techniques, tools, and best practices along the way.

## Current Progress

As of now, I've started the challenge and have completed a few basic projects. You can find them in the repository as individual files and directories for each project.

## Completed Projects

Here are some of the projects I've completed so far:

1. **Hangman Game**  
   A simple text-based Hangman game where the user guesses letters to complete the word.

2. **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   A game where the user competes against the computer in a classic Rock Paper Scissors match.

3. **Calculator**  
   A basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. **Blackjack**  
   The popular card game blackjack were the user tries to get as close as possible to 21 while competeing against the dealer and trying not to go bust!

## Project List

Hereâ€™s a list of the projects I plan to complete throughout the 100 days. The complexity will increase as I continue the challenge:

1. Basic games (e.g., Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, etc.)
2. Text-based applications (e.g., to-do list, calendar, etc.)
3. Web scraping tools
4. Simple data analysis scripts
5. GUI applications (using Tkinter or other libraries)
6. Machine learning and AI projects
7. Web development with Flask or Django
8. And more...

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries and frameworks:
  - `Tkinter` (for GUI applications)
  - `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` (for web scraping)
  - `pandas`, `matplotlib` (for data analysis and visualization)
  - `Flask`, `Django` (for web development)
  - `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn` (for machine learning)
